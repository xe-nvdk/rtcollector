# rtcollector

> A modular, RedisTimeSeries-native observability agent.  
> Designed for developers, tinkerers, and infrastructure teams who want full control over metrics collection, without the bloat.

---

## 🧠 What is `rtcollector`?

`rtcollector` is a lightweight, plugin-based agent for collecting system and application metrics, and pushing them to [RedisTimeSeries](https://redis.io/timeseries/).

It works like [Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/), but is designed specifically for the Redis Stack ecosystem.

Think of it as your Redis-native observability layer: simple, fast, hackable.

---

## 🤔 Why does it exist?

Because most modern observability agents:
- Are too bloated or overkill for smaller projects or edge deployments
- Assume you're using Prometheus, InfluxDB, or Elastic
- Lack good support for RedisTimeSeries as a first-class output
- Why not?

`rtcollector` was born out of the need for:

✅ Something modular  
✅ Configurable with a YAML file  
✅ Built with RedisStack in mind  
✅ Small enough to embed anywhere (VMs, Docker, homelabs, edge devices)

---

## ✅ What it can do (today)

- ⏱️ Collect metrics at configurable intervals
- 📦 Modular input plugins (Linux CPU, Mem, Disk, etc.)
- 🚀 Push metrics to RedisTimeSeries (via `TS.ADD`)
- ⚙️ Fully YAML-configurable. No code changes needed to enable/disable plugins
- 📚 Built with Python and easy to extend
- 💻 Support for MacOS and Linux
- 🏷️ Label-based key creation with per-host and per-core tags
- 🐞 Debug logging and one-shot execution support
- 🐳 Docker metrics via container stats and engine info
- 📥 Receive and index logs via Syslog input (RFC5424/RFC3164) using RedisSearch
- 🕒 Per-plugin timing with slow detection and warning indicators
- 🐬 Collect metrics from MariaDB servers using `SHOW GLOBAL STATUS`, configurable and with authentication support
- ⏳ Support for human-readable retention settings (e.g., `1d`, `12h`, `1y`) for RedisTimeSeries
- 📦 Memory buffering for metrics and logs during Redis downtime with automatic flush and progress bar
- 🌐 Optional SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy support for Redis-based outputs, including authentication

## ✍️ Exec Plugin Formats

The `exec` input plugin supports two output formats from your script:

### `json` format (structured logs + metrics):

```json
{
  "metrics": {
    "cpu_temp": 72.3,
    "disk_used": 81
  },
  "logs": [
    {
      "message": "CPU temp is normal",
      "level": "info"
    }
  ]
}
```

### `metrics` format (line-by-line for RedisTimeSeries):

```
cpu_temp 72.4 source=exec host=atila
disk_usage_percent 84.3 source=exec host=atila ts=1716734400123
```

- Each line includes a metric name, value, optional labels (`key=value`), and optional timestamp (`ts=...` in milliseconds).
---

## 🧰 Configuration Notes

### ⏱️ Collection and Flushing Intervals

- `interval`: Defines how often input plugins are executed (in seconds). Each plugin will collect new metrics on this interval.
- `flush_interval`: (optional) Defines how often buffered data is flushed to output plugins. If not set, it defaults to the same as `interval`.

### 🧵 Buffering Behavior

- If an output (e.g., Redis) becomes unavailable, `rtcollector` will buffer collected metrics and logs in memory.
- The buffer is size-limited via `max_buffer_size` (default: 5000).
- Once the output is available again, buffered data is flushed in the next cycle.
- Buffered metrics and logs are shown in the debug output with a progress bar.

### 🌐 Proxy Support

- Redis outputs support SOCKS5 and SOCKS4 proxying, useful in restricted networks or jump-box scenarios.
- Add a `socks5_proxy` or `socks4_proxy` field under any Redis-based output:

  ```yaml
  outputs:
    - redissearch:
        host: redis.example.com
        port: 6379
        index: "logs_idx"
        key_prefix: "log:"
        # Optional proxy with authentication
        # socks5_proxy: "socks5://user:pass@127.0.0.1:1080"
  ```

- Proxy support is optional and applied only if configured.

### 🐘 PostgreSQL Plugin

The PostgreSQL input plugin collects metrics from PostgreSQL databases:

- **Database Statistics**: Collects metrics from `pg_stat_database` for each database (connections, transactions, blocks read/hit, etc.)
- **Background Writer**: Monitors checkpoint operations, buffer usage, and write operations from `pg_stat_bgwriter`
- **Replication**: Tracks replication lag in seconds from `pg_stat_replication`

Configuration options:
- `host`, `port`, `user`, `password`, `dbname`: Connection parameters
- `collect_bgwriter`: Enable/disable background writer metrics (default: true)
- `collect_replication`: Enable/disable replication metrics (default: true)
- `queries`: Custom SQL queries to collect additional metrics

Example metrics:
- `postgres_numbackends`: Number of active connections per database
- `postgres_xact_commit`: Committed transactions per database
- `postgres_bgwriter_checkpoints_timed`: Number of scheduled checkpoints
- `postgres_replication_lag_seconds`: Replication lag in seconds per replica

### 📅 Retention Policy

- You can configure the data retention period in a more human-readable format.
- The `retention` field in your config can now use:
  - `"7d"` for 7 days
  - `"12h"` for 12 hours
  - `"1y"` for 1 year
- These values are automatically converted into milliseconds for RedisTimeSeries.
- You can still use raw millisecond values if needed (e.g., `retention: 86400000`).
